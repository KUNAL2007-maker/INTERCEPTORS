// nodes (wallets tagged by layer + VASP attribution), transfers (edges), and the
// case metadata. Live when provider keys are set AND the address parses to a
// supported chain; the deterministic mock otherwise, so the demo works with zero
// configuration and the endpoint never answers with an error.
//
// Two modes:
//   • default        — the full walk (up to ~40 wallets, dozens of API calls)
//   • { probe: true } — the seed wallet only, ~2 API calls, returns just its
//                       current outgoing tx hashes.
//
// The probe exists for the live-feed poll. Re-walking the whole tree once a
// minute costs ~80 Etherscan calls/min, which is ~115,000/day against a
// 100,000/day key — the console would quota itself out inside a day of being
// left open on a desk. A poll only needs to answer "has anything moved?".
